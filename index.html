		<p class="og-ref">Page 2</p>
		<p>Each player except one controls a player character (PC). You decide what your PC thinks and feels, what they say and do&mdash;but not what happens to them. It is your job as a player to immerse yourself in your PC. They may be an adventurer in a faraway fantasy world&mdash;but they are still, at heart, a person with feelings and dreams, just like you. Try to imagine&mdash;how would you react if you were in their shoes? What would you do? The player characters are always the protagonists of the story. The game is about you. Your decisions, your adventures.</p>

		<p class="og-ref">Page 2</p>
		<p>The final player is the Gamemaster, the GM. They describe the game world to you, they portray the people you meet, and they control the enemies you fight. The game is a conversation between the players and the GM, back and forth, until a critical situation arises where the outcome is uncertain. Then it's time to break out the dice&mdash;read more about this in <a href="#chapter-3">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
		<p>It is the GM's job to put obstacles in your path and challenge your PCs, forcing them to show what they're really made of. But it is not up to the GM to decide everything that happens in the game&mdash;and above all, not how your story is supposed to end. That is decided in the game. That is why you are playing the game&mdash;to find out how your story ends.</p>

<p class="og-ref">Page 2</p>
<p>The Year Zero Engine was originally developed as the ruleset for <a href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/games/mutant-year-zero/">Mutant: Year Zero</a>, but has been further modified and adapted to a wide range of games with different themes and settings. Yet, six core features of the game remain the same in all iterations. These are listed and explained below.</p>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
		<h4 id="accessible">Accessible<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#accessible" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 2</p>
		<p>The basics of the Year Zero Engine are very easy to learn. It is easy to teach to new players, making the barrier to play very low. Complexity and depth are added piece by piece, offering more choices to the player as they gain more insight into the system.</p>
		<h4 id="fast-and-decisive">Fast and Decisive<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#fast-and-decisive" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 2</p>
		<p>The Year Zero Engine is fast, quickly producing meaningful results by removing any dice rolling, bookkeeping and calculations that don't move the action forward. Year Zero Engine combat systems are often deadly, pushing conflicts to decisive moments. The risks are high, and PCs are rarely safe from danger no matter how experienced they are.</p>
		<h4 id="risks-and-rewards">Risks &amp; Rewards<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#risks-and-rewards" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 2</p>
		<p>In the Year Zero Engine, you can increase your chances significantly by pushing your roll&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, re-rolling the dice&mdash;but pushing always comes with a cost. This dynamic constantly pushes you to weigh risks and rewards, and makes the Year Zero Engine particularly suited for harsh, survival-focused games.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
		<h4 id="player-centric">Player-Centric<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#player-centric" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
		<p>In Year Zero Engine games, the players and their characters are at the heart of the story. The PCs are the protagonists of the story, never the NPCs. The rules focus on the PCs and their actions, while NPCs are handled quickly and effectively by the Gamemaster. The system is designed to always present the players with meaningful choices.</p>
		<h4 id="story-driven">Story Driven<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#story-driven" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
		<p>Roleplaying is about creating stories, memorable moments at the gaming table that you'll remember for years to come. The Year Zero Engine is designed to produce dramatic effects that will push your story forward and make it take unexpected turns.</p>
		<h4 id="adaptable">Adaptable<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#adaptable" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
		<p>The Year Zero Engine is designed to be very adaptable for different play styles, themes, and game settings. By using <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> and talents in a modular fashion, the system creates building blocks that are very easily added, removed, and re-engineered.</p>

		<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
		<p>Year Zero Engine games typically give you plenty of room for improvisation and creativity. Yet they also provide a number of tools to help you create your own story.</p>
		<h4 id="character-sheets">Character Sheets<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#character-sheets" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
		<p>To document your character, you use a character sheet. This document does not include a character sheet, as any YZE game will need a sheet adapted to the specific rules version and game setting. How you create your character will be described in the next chapter.</p>
		<div id="define-dice">
			<h4 id="dice">Dice<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#dice" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
			<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
			<p>As a character in a Year Zero Engine game, you will have to take risks. Sooner or later, you will end up in situations where the outcome is uncertain, no matter how skilled you are. It's time to break out the dice. Every Year Zero Game is different, but two main forks can be identified&mdash;the original dice pool variety (using pools of D6s) and the more recent step dice version (using a variety of polyhedral dice). Both versions are included in this SRD. When designing your game, you can choose whichever version you prefer.</p>

				<dt>Dice Pool Version</dt>
				<dd>Regular six-sided dice (also called D6) are required to play the dice pool version YZE, preferably 10&ndash;15 of them.</dd>
				<dt>Step Dice Version</dt>
				<dd>The step dice version of YZE uses polyhedral dice, including D6, D8, D10 and D12. Some rules variations require dice in different <a href="#define-color">colors</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Rolling Dice</dt>
				<dd>The rules will sometimes ask you to roll D3, 2D6, D66, and D100. D3 means you roll a D6 and divide the result by two, rounding up. 2D6 means you roll two six-sided dice and add the results. D66 means you roll two D6. The first die represents the tens digit and the second die represents the ones digit. That generates a result between 11 and 66. D100 means you roll two D10. The first represents the tens digit and the second the ones digit. A double zero counts as 100. You can even roll D666, by rolling three six-sided dice. The first die then counts as the hundreds digit, the second as the tens digit and the third as the ones digit.</dd>

		<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
		<p>Another useful accessory for YZE games is a custom card deck. The cards can be used as reference sheets for <a href="#define-gear">gear</a> or NPCs, but also to randomize <a href="#define-initiative">initiative</a> in combat&mdash;read more about this in <a href="#chapter-4">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
			<p>Three units are used to measure time in YZE games, depending on the situation at hand. The exact duration of a round, stretch and shift can vary depending on the situation. It's the GM's job to track time and determine when another round, stretch or shift has passed. There are typically four shifts in a day: morning, day, evening, and night.</p>

		<p class="og-ref">Page 3</p>
		<p>In YZE games, you are largely in control of the story, and with this comes responsibility. The player characters will face great danger and difficult challenges, but no player should find the situations they experience unpleasant or offensive. It is important that everyone around the gaming table is having fun and feeling safe.</p>
		<p>Before starting the game, talk things through and see if someone wants certain subjects to be kept out of the game. Always respect a player who wants to pause and discuss what is happening in the game, or even leave the table if the player so chooses. And you may also want to talk about what happened after the game session.</p>

		<p class="og-ref">Page 4</p>
		<p>Your player character (PC) is your most important asset in any Year Zero Engine game. They are your avatar, your eyes and ears in the world. But they, in return, depend on you making the right decisions for them. Take your PC seriously and play them as if they were a real person. It's more fun that way. At the same time, don't try to protect your PC from every conceivable danger. The goal of the game is to create a good story. For that to happen you need to take risks.</p>
		<p>During the course of the game, your PC will change and develop. Their <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> and <a href="#define-specialty">specialties</a> can be developed through <a href="#define-experience">experience</a>, but you can also discover how their <a href="#define-personality-trait">personality</a> changes and is formed in a way that cannot be measured by numbers on a page. This is when your player character truly comes alive.</p>
		<p>To create your player character, you need a <a href="#define-tools">character sheet</a>. This SRD does not include a character sheet, as any YZE game will need a sheet adapted to the specific rules version and game setting.</p>

			<p>How you create your player character is explained in detail in this chapter. The summary below is a helpful overview. Grab a character sheet, a pencil, and follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Choose your <a href="#define-archetype">archetype</a>.</li>

	<h3 id="archetype">Archetype<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#archetype" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
	<p class="og-ref">Page 4</p>
	<p>Most Year Zero Engine games have some type of character archetypes to choose from. The archetypes&mdash;which can also be called "roles," "professions," or "careers"&mdash;are based on the game world, and help the players grasp the setting.</p>
	<p>The archetype determines what type of person you are, your background and role in the group. Your archetype will influence your attributes, <a href="#define-skill">skills</a>, <a href="#define-specialty">specialties</a>, and starting <a href="#define-gear">gear</a>.</p>
	<p>Archetypes can feel stereotypical, and they are meant to be. Picking an archetype is a quick way for yourself and the other players to get an immediate feel for your character. But remember that your character is more than just their archetype. The archetype is just a starting point toward creating a unique player character.</p>

	<p>Your character has four attributes that indicate your basic physical and mental capabilities.

			<p>The Crafting skill is primarily used to repair broken <a href="#define-gear">gear</a> or building new items, but it can also be used to understand or operate mechanical constructions.

			<p>The Observation skill can be used to examine an area to find useful information or to spot something or someone from a distance. When the GM calls for it, you can make a passive roll for this skill to detect an approaching threat in time. When examining an area, the GM can give you a positive <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a> if your description of where you are searching is very precise, or even let you succeed without a roll.</p>

			<p>In many YZE games, your PC risks getting hurt. This is when the Healing skill is useful. It can be used to get a <a href="#define-broken">broken</a> character back on their feet, or even save their life if they suffered a <a href="#define-critical-injury">critical injury</a>.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 13</p>
			<p>This skill represents the ability to read other people and see through lies. Roll for Insight to assess an NPC's mood. If you succeed, the GM must reveal the NPC's current, most powerful emotion&mdash;hate, fear, contempt, love, <em>etc.</em> If you roll several successes, you can also determine if an NPC is lying&mdash;but not exactly what they are lying about or what the truth is. The Insight skill can also be used in <a href="#define-opposed-roll">opposed rolls</a> to resist <a href="#define-persuasion">Persuasion</a>.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 13</p>
			<p>Sometimes, you can make things go your way without resorting to violence. Instead, you trick or convince your opponents without drawing your weapon. For this, you use the Persuasion skill. If your opponent is actively trying to resist you, it's an <a href="#define-opposed-roll">opposed roll</a> against their <a href="#define-insight">Insight</a>. If not, it's a straight roll.</p>
			<p>Before you roll, you must state the stakes of the roll&mdash;what you want to achieve. What you ask of your opponent must be within reason. No NPC will agree to do anything you want or act directly against their own interests, no matter how good your roll is. Conversely, you don't need to roll for simple requests that your opponent has no reason to resist. The GM has the final say on when Persuasion rolls can or need to be used.</p>

			<dd>When you interrogate a prisoner to gain information, roll against their <a href="#define-stamina">Stamina</a> instead of their <a href="#define-insight">Insight</a>.

			<p>Specialties are tricks, moves and minor abilities that give you a small edge. In some Year Zero Engine games, they are instead called talents. Specialties are more narrow than <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> and give you a way to fine-tune your character.</p>
			<p>You can typically pick one specialty when creating your character, but your <a href="#define-archetype">archetype</a> determines which specialties you can choose from. You can learn more specialties during the course of the game.</p>
			<p>Most specialties are tuned to the specific game and its setting.</p>
			<p>While <a href="#define-attribute">attributes</a> and <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> give you the broad strokes of your competency, specialties represent specific areas of expertise. Specialties are unique tricks and talents that give you an edge and keep your adversaries guessing.</p>
			<p>You typically start the game with just one or a few specialties, with your choice limited by your archetype. You can <a href="#define-experience">learn more specialties</a> during the game, without being limited by your archetype.</p>
			<p>This section includes a limited number of general specialties, as the selection of specialties in a specific game are closely tailored to its setting and theme. The specialties listed here should be considered examples only.</p>

				<p>In most YZE games, specialties are not rated&mdash;you either have them or you don't. Some games, however, have specialties tiered in ranks&mdash;usually three.

			<dl>
				<dt>Tracking</dt>
				<dd>The obvious way to manage consumables is to simply track them on your character sheet. Write down every ration of food, arrow or bullet, and reduce the amount as they are used up. A ration of food, ten arrows, or 25 bullets typically count as Â¼ of a regular item.</dd>
				<dt>Supply Rolls</dt>
				<dd>To emulate the scarcity of consumables without tracking each and every unit, you can use supply rolls. For each consumable in the game, you have a Supply rating. A higher rating is better. For encumbrance, each consumable counts as one regular item no matter the Supply rating. <span class="d-block mt-1">At regular intervals (depending on the consumable in question), you need to make a supply roll. This means rolling a number of D6 equal to the current Supply rating&mdash;but never more than six dice. For each 1 rolled, the Supply rating is reduced by one. When the Supply rating reaches zero, you're out of the consumable. </span><span class="d-block mt-1">If you want to give a consumable to another person, simply increase the recipient's Supply rating as many steps as you decrease your own.</span></dd>

	<p class="og-ref">Page 9, Page 10</p>
	<p>Your initial <a href="#define-skill-roll">skill roll</a> reflects a safe and controlled action. If you fail your initial roll, or if you want additional successes, you can lean into the action, giving it everything you've got, pushing yourself to the limit. This is called pushing the roll, and lets you re-roll any dice that don't show the result of 1.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Banes</dt>
		<dd>A base die showing a 1 is called a bane and can never be re-rolled when pushing. After a push, you cannot change back to the previous result. All dice count after the push, even any dice you didn't re-roll.</dd>
		<dt>Passive Rolls</dt>
		<dd>You can only push <a href="#define-skill-roll">skill rolls</a> when you actively perform an action. When passive or unaware, for example when rolling <a href="#define-observation">Observation</a> to see if you spot a sneaking enemy, you cannot push the roll.</dd>
		<dt>Only Once</dt>
		<dd>You can only push a <a href="#define-skill-roll">skill roll</a> once. If you don't succeed on your second try, you are stuck dealing with the consequences. <span class="d-block mt-1 og-omit">As a rule, you only have one chance to succeed with any action. Once you have rolled the dice&mdash;and pushed the roll&mdash;you may not roll again to achieve the same goal. You need to try something different or wait until the circumstances have changed in a substantial way. Or let another player character try. This rule does not apply to combat, where you can attack the same enemy multiple times.</span></dd>
		<dt>Cost of Pushing</dt>

If this <a href="#define-damage">damage or stress</a> <a href="#define-broken">breaks</a> you, this happens after the action is resolved. <span class="d-block mt-1">As an option, when using a weapon or a tool of some sort, the tool suffers damage (or reduced durability) instead of you. </span><span class="d-block mt-1">Note that this pushing version works best in the <a href="#define-dice">step dice</a> version of YZE, as having more dice to roll in a <a href="#define-dice">dice pool</a> will increase the risk of suffering <a href="#define-damage">damage or stress</a> when pushing.</span></p>
		<h5 id="push-attribute-damage">Attribute Damage<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#push-attribute-damage" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
		<p>For each <a href="#define-push">bane</a> (1) rolled on your base dice after a <a href="#define-push">pushed roll</a>, you immediately suffer one point of damage directly on the <a href="#define-attribute">attribute</a> rolled for. Only the base dice from the attribute count, not base dice from <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> or <a href="#define-gear">gear</a>. For this reason, you should preferably have base dice of separate colors for attributes, skills, and gear. For each bane rolled for a piece of gear in a pushed roll, the bonus from the gear is reduced by one step. If this <a href="#define-damage">damage or stress</a> <a href="#define-broken">breaks</a> you or your gear, this happens after the action is resolved. Note that this pushing version requires <a href="#define-attribute-damage">attribute damage</a>. <span class="d-block mt-1">In some YZE games using attribute damage, rolling banes on base dice can also have positive effects&mdash;it gives you the force of will required to use special abilities like <a href="#define-magic-discipline">magic</a>.

		<p>When <a href="#define-push">pushing a roll</a>, you immediately suffer a <a href="#define-condition">condition</a> of some sort, such as Exhausted, Angry, or Scared. For each condition you haven, you suffer a negative <a href="#define-modifier">modification</a> on some or all <a href="#define-skill-roll">skill rolls</a>. <a href="#define-condition">Conditions</a> also work as cues for roleplaying.

			<p class="og-ref">Page 15</p>
			<p>A violent conflict is typically played out using a map of the location where your characters happen to find themselves fighting for their lives.</p>
			<p>The map is divided into zones. A zone is typically a room, a corridor, or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies&mdash;from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is generally smaller in a <a href="#define-zone-feature">cramped</a> environment than in open <a href="#define-terrain">terrain</a>.</p>
			<p>In pre-made scenario material, zones are usually indicated on a location map. In random encounters created on the fly, the GM can make a quick sketch of the area or simply describe it.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 15, Page 24</p>
			<p>Zones can have various features, which affect actions performed within them. Here are some examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Cluttered</dt>
				<dd>The <a href="#define-zone">zone</a> is covered by dense undergrowth or filled with debris of some sort. You must roll for <a href="#define-mobility">Mobility</a> when you move into the zone. Failure means you manage to get into the zone, but you fall down.</dd>
				<dt>Cramped</dt>
				<dd>A crawlspace or narrow tunnel. In a cramped <a href="#define-zone">zone</a>, you can only crawl, not run. You also cannot move or shoot past individuals next to you against targets behind them.</dd>
				<dt>Dimly Lit</dt>
				<dd>The <a href="#define-zone">zone</a> is dimly lit. <a href="#define-observation">Observation</a> rolls in the zone get a &minus;2 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a>. <a href="#define-ranged-combat">Ranged</a> attacks into the zone also suffer a &minus;2 modifier, and can't pass through the zone.</dd>
				<dt>Darkness</dt>
				<dd>In complete darkness, you have no choice but to feel your way around. To run in complete darkness requires a successful <a href="#define-mobility">Mobility</a> roll, and you take one point of damage if you fail. You can attack opponents at <a href="#define-range">Engaged range</a> normally in darkness, but with a &minus;2 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a>. At <a href="#define-range">Short range</a>, you must roll for <a href="#define-observation">Observation</a> successfully (no action) to be able to attack the target, also with a &minus;2 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a>. You cannot hit targets at <a href="#define-range">Medium range</a> or more in total darkness.</dd>

			<p>Although maps can be useful, you can always choose not to use them and let certain conflicts play out only in the "theater of the mind." This can be a good solution in close quarters conflicts between a small number of combatants.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 15</p>
			<p>Combat is played out in <a href="#define-time">rounds</a>, each roughly 5&ndash;10 seconds long. When combat begins, the first step is to determine who has the initiative. Do this before anyone rolls dice for an action.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Drawing Initiative<dt>
				<dd>Grab ten cards, numbered 1 through 10. A suit of any normal deck of cards works fine if you remove the face cards and count the ace as 1. <span class="d-block mt-1">Each player taking part in the conflict, either voluntarily or involuntarily, draws a card and the GM draws one card for each NPC (or group). This is called drawing the initiative. The number on the card determines the order in which you act in the conflict. </span><span class="d-block mt-1">Participants act in order from lowest to highest number, beginning with card #1, until everyone has taken their turn. Place your initiative card by your character sheet, so everyone can see in which order you all act. The GM places their initiative card(s) in front of them. </span><span class="d-block mt-1">When all the participants in the combat have acted once, the <a href="#define-time">round</a> is over, and a new round begins. The round order remains the same throughout the whole conflict&mdash;drawing initiative is only done once, at the start of the first round.</span></dd>
				<dt>Surprise</dt>
				<dd>If you initiate combat with an attack that the GM deems fully surprising, you get to choose any initiative you want instead of drawing a random card. All other combatants&mdash;including others on your side&mdash;draw initiative normally. Also see <a href="#define-sneak-attack">Ambushes</a>.</dd>
				<dt>NPC Initiative</dt>
				<dd>For a group of NPCs with identical stats, the GM can, if they want, draw one initiative card for the group instead of one per individual. All the NPCs in that group act at the same point in the <a href="#define-time">round</a> order. In what order they act individually within the group is up to the GM.</dd>

		<p class="og-ref">Page 16</p>
		<p>The point in the <a href="#define-initiative">initiative</a> order at which you act is called your turn. The phrase "your next turn" means the next upcoming point in the initiative order at which you normally act, whether that happens to be in the current <a href="#define-time">round</a> or the next round (if your turn in the current <a href="#define-time">Round</a> has already passed). The phrase "your previous turn" means your latest previous point in the initiative order, whether it was in the current round or the previous round.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Exchanging Initiative</dt>
			<dd>During a fight, you can exchange your initiative card&mdash;and thus your <a href="#define-initiative">initiative</a>&mdash;with another player character or NPC, whose turn has not yet come up in the current <a href="#define-time">round</a> (if such a character exists). This must be declared on your turn, before you perform any action. <span class="d-block mt-1">The other character cannot resist this exchange, and must take their turn immediately. A character is not allowed to immediately exchange their initiative when just given a new one. They may, however, exchange this new initiative in the following <a href="#define-time">Round</a>.</span></dd>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 16</p>
			<p>As an alternative rule to create more uncertainty, you can keep <a href="#define-initiative">initiative</a> cards secret. The GM then calls out initiative numbers, starting at #1, and each combatant shows their card and performs their actions once their number comes up. In this variant, the initiative must be drawn again at the start of each <a href="#define-time">round</a>.</p>

				<dt>Describe Your Actions</dt>
				<dd>When it's your turn to act, simply state which actions you wish to perform and roll dice if needed to see if you are successful. Some actions will give your opponent the opportunity to perform a reactive action that breaks the turn order.</dd>
				<dt>Helping Others</dt>
				<dd>If you wish to <a href="#define-help">help</a> another player character or NPC perform an action, it costs you one action of the same kind (slow or fast). You must state you are trying to help someone before any dice are rolled. Helping others occurs out of turn, <em>i.e.</em>, it breaks the <a href="#define-initiative">initiative</a> order in the <a href="#define-time">round</a>.</dd>

			<p>Because <a href="#define-help">helping</a> and reactive actions occur out of turn, it can be hard to keep track of how many actions the combatants have performed. A tip is to keep track of this by turning the <a href="#define-initiative">initiative</a> card 90 degrees for every performed action. Turn it to the left for a <a href="#define-action">fast action</a> and to the right for a <a href="#define-action">slow action</a>, and all the way around 180 degrees once both actions in the turn are used up.

		<p class="og-ref">Page 18</p>
		<p>Ammunition for firearms can be handled in different ways, depending on the technological level of the game setting and level of complexity you want in your game. You can count every bullet, handle ammunition via <a href="#define-consumable">supply rolls</a>, or use the more extensive <a href="#define-ammo-dice">ammo dice</a> system. Simple single-shot <a href="#define-weapon">weapons</a> need to be reloaded after each shot. Reloading a firearm is a <a href="#define-action">slow action</a>.</p>

				<h6 class="h6" id="ammo-dice">Ammo Dice<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#ammo-dice" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h6>
				<p class="og-ref">Page 19</p>
				<p>If you want more detail and complexity for managing firearms, you can use the ammo dice system. Ammo dice are always D6s, and should have a separate color from base dice. In this system, all firearms have a rate of fire (RoF) rating, from 2 for a typical pistol to 5 or 6 for full-auto <a href="#define-weapon">weapons</a>.</p>
				<p>You can add as many ammo dice to your attack as you like, from zero up to RoF or the number of <a href="#define-time">rounds</a> left in the magazine minus one, whichever is lower. For example, if you have three rounds left, you can add up to two ammo dice. If you have only one round left, you cannot add any ammo dice to our roll. In this case, or if you choose to use no ammo dice, only one (1) round of ammunition is used in the attack.</p>
				<p>Rolling a 6 on an ammo die is a success just like with a D6 base die, but successes on ammo dice do not contribute to hitting your target. Instead, if your attack hits (checking only the base dice), each success your ammo dice can be used to either increase the damage by one step or to trigger an additional hit on the same target or on a secondary target in the same <a href="#define-zone">zone</a>. Each additional hit inflicts base damage and the damage is increased by one for each further success you spend on it.</p>
				<p>After your roll, you sum up the D6 digits on all of your ammo dice, then add one (1) to the result. This sum is the total amount of ammunition you have spent on the attack. If the sum on your ammo dice is equal to or more than the number of rounds you have left in the magazine, your magazine is completely emptied.</p>

		<p>Bows and slingshots cannot be "reloaded" as such&mdash;instead, you need to spend a <a href="#define-action">fast action</a> to prepare the weapon by nocking an arrow or placing a stone in your sling.

			<p>As a <a href="#define-action">fast action</a>, you can assume an overwatch position in a specified direction, as long as you have a ranged weapon and no enemies within <a href="#define-range">Engaged range</a>. This means that you aim in the specified direction and are ready to shoot. Between the time you assume the overwatch position and your time to act in the next <a href="#define-time">round</a>, you can fire your weapon against a target in the chosen direction.</p>
			<p>You can fire whenever you want in the turn order, and your shot is resolved before all other actions&mdash;even if they are already declared. For example, if an enemy in the direction you are aiming declares that they want to fire a weapon, you can shoot first. The enemy is not allowed to change their attack after your overwatch attack.</p>
			<p>Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal attack (a <a href="#define-action">slow action</a>). Therefore, you must save your <a href="#define-action">slow action</a> in the round for any overwatch attack you want to make.</p>

		<dt>Getting Conditions</dt>
		<dd>You can get conditions by <a href="#define-push">pushing a dice roll</a>. When pushing a roll for <a href="#define-attribute">Strength or Agility</a>, you get a physical condition of your choice. When pushing a roll for <a href="#define-attribute">Wits or Empathy</a>, you get a mental condition of your choice.</dd>
		<dt>Damage &amp; Stress</dt>
		<dd>Damage from external attacks gives you one physical condition of your choice for each point of <a href="#define-damage">damage</a>. Stressful situations give you a number of mental conditions equal to the amount of potential <a href="#define-damage">stress</a>, reduced by one for each success on an <a href="#define-insight">Insight</a> roll.</dd>
		<dt>Effects of Conditions</dt>
		<dd>Each physical condition you have gives you a &minus;1 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a> to <a href="#define-skill-roll">skills rolls</a> using <a href="#define-attribute">Strength or Agility</a>, while each mental condition gives you &minus;1 to rolls for <a href="#define-attribute">Wits or Empathy</a>.

			<p class="og-ref">Page 21</p>
			<p>In most YZE games, your PC can be broken by <a href="#define-damage">damage or stress</a>. Being broken basically means you are taken out of action, and you might risk even lethal injuries. When broken, you can't perform any actions or roll for any <a href="#define-skill">skills</a>.</p>
			<p>How you get broken depends on the specific damage system used:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Health &amp; Resolve</dt>
				<dd>In a system using <a href="#define-health-resolve">Health and Resolve</a>, you are broken if either of these scores are reduced to zero by <a href="#define-damage">damage or stress</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Attribute Damage</dt>
				<dd>In a system using <a href="#define-attribute-damage">attribute damage</a>, you are broken if any <a href="#define-attribute">attribute</a> is reduced to zero.</dd>
				<dt>Conditions</dt>
				<dd>In a system using <a href="#define-condition">conditions</a>, you are broken when you have suffered a set number of physical or mental conditions.</dd>
				<dt>More Damage</dt>
				<dd>You can't go below zero in <a href="#define-health-resolve">Health</a>, <a href="#define-health-resolve">Resolve</a>, or any <a href="#define-attribute">attribute</a>.

		<p>Being <a href="#define-broken">broken</a> is not fatal in itself&mdash;only <a href="#define-critical-injury">critical injuries</a> can actually kill you. There are two ways to recover after being broken, assuming you're not dead.</p>

The <a href="#define-healing">Healing</a> roll only has this effect on a <a href="#define-broken">broken</a> victim.</dd>
			<dt>On Your Own</dt>
			<dd>If no one is around to help you, you automatically heal one point of <a href="#define-damage">damage or stress</a> after one <a href="#define-time">Shift</a> has passed.</dd>
			<dt>Not Broken?</dt>
			<dd>If you are not <a href="#define-broken">broken</a>, you heal one point of <a href="#define-damage">damage or stress</a> per <a href="#define-time">shift</a>.

				<dt>Rolling for the Crit</dt>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 27</p>
			<p>The rules so far in this chapter mainly deal with a fight between two parties. A different type of confrontation is the chase. Chases can be on foot or use <a href="#define-vehicle">vehicles</a>.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Starting the Chase</dt>
				<dd>A chase can either start directly from a roleplaying situation, or it can follow directly after combat if someone runs off. In either case, the GM declares that a chase is now in progress and decides the starting <a href="#define-range">range</a> between the participants, up to a maximum of <a href="#define-range">Long range</a>. <span class="d-block mt-1">Distances in a chase are measured only in <a href="#define-range">range categories</a> (not <a href="#define-zone">zones</a>). Most chases are between just two parties&mdash;the pursuer and their prey. A chase can have <a href="#define-chase-multiple">multiple participants</a>.</span></dd>
			</dl>
		</div>
		<h4 id="resolution">Resolution<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#resolution" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h4>
		<p class="og-ref">Page 27</p>
		<p>Chases are played out in <a href="#define-time">rounds</a> like combat, but no <a href="#define-initiative">initiative</a> is drawn and normal actions are not performed. Instead, each participant gets one maneuver each round, chosen in secret and then revealed, while the GM randomly generates obstacles to place in their way. Obstacles can be rolled up using the <a href="#define-chase-obstacles-foot">foot chase obstacles</a> and <a href="#define-chase-obstacles-vehicle">vehicle chase obstacles</a> tables. The following procedure is used each round of the chase:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Each participant selects a maneuver, in secret.</li>
			<li>The GM randomly generates an obstacle and reveals it.</li>
			<li>The pursuer and prey both reveal their maneuver.</li>
			<li>Maneuvers are resolved, with the prey going first and the pursuer last.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>A PC or NPC is allowed to cancel a planned maneuver, but no other maneuver may be chosen instead&mdash;the participant simply does nothing in the round.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 27</p>
			<p>If one participant in a chase is running while the other is in a <a href="#define-vehicle">vehicle</a>, the chase rules work normally&mdash;just use the applicable <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> for each participant. In a bustling street environment, it's not necessarily faster to be driving, but the driver will be more protected. However, in a more open environment where the greater speed of a vehicle comes into play, the participant in a vehicle gets a +2 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a> to all <a href="#define-chase-pursue-flee">Pursue/Flee</a> rolls in a chase against an opponent on foot.</p>
			<div id="define-chase-multiple">
				<h5 class="h6" id="multiple-participants">Multiple Participants<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#multiple-participants" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
				<p class="og-ref">Page 28</p>
				<p>If there are more than two participants in a chase, there are two ways to resolve it. The simplest way is to divide the participants into two sides. Only the slowest person/<a href="#define-vehicle">vehicle</a> on each side&mdash;the one with the lowest <a href="#define-skill">skill</a> level after the Maneuverability <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a> (free choice on a tie)&mdash;performs maneuvers and rolls dice, except for the <a href="#define-chase-stand-and-shoot">Stand and Shoot</a> maneuver, which all participants on the side can perform.</p>
				<p> A more complex way to resolve chases with multiple participants is to let each perform maneuvers separately. You will then need to keep track of the relative distances between each participant. A sheet of paper indicating range bands can be useful for this. In this model, the <a href="#define-chase-pursue-flee">Pursue/Flee</a> maneuver will move you forward relative to all other participants in the chase. For all other maneuvers, you must indicate which other participant you wish to target, and all limitations refer to your position relative to the target. You count as pursuer in relation to all participants in front of you, and as prey in relation to all participants behind you.</p>

		<p class="og-ref">Page 27</p>
		<p>In each <a href="#define-time">round</a> of a chase, each participant can perform one maneuver, all described below. The maneuvers are chosen secretly&mdash;either using cards or by just writing them on a piece of paper.</p>
		<p>Maneuvers require <a href="#define-skill-roll">skill rolls</a>.

			<p>You simply run or drive as fast as you can. Roll <a href="#define-mobility">Mobility</a> [Driving]. For each success rolled, the distance to the other participant decreases (if the pursuer) or increases (if the prey) by one <a href="#define-range">range category</a>.</p>
			<ul class="og-list-diamond">
				<li>If the range exceeds <a href="#define-range">Extreme</a> after both maneuvers in the <a href="#define-time">round</a> are resolved, the chase is over.</li>
				<li>If the range is <a href="#define-range">Engaged</a> (or less) after both maneuvers are resolved, the pursuer may immediately make a <a href="#define-close-combat">close combat</a> attack [<a href="#define-vehicle-combat">ramming attack</a> for <a href="#define-vehicle">vehicles</a>]. The range stays at <a href="#define-range">Engaged</a>.</li>
				<li>If the range would go below <a href="#define-range">Engaged</a>, and the pursuer declines to attack as per above, they can either stay at <a href="#define-range">Engaged range</a> or overtake the prey, and now become the prey themselves, at a distance defined by the number of excess (one excess = <a href="#define-range">Short range</a>, <em>etc.</em>).

			<p>You quickly duck into a side alley or hide behind something. This maneuver can only be done by the prey, and never at <a href="#define-range">Short range</a> or less. If the range is <a href="#define-range">Medium</a>, you get a &minus;2 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a>.

			<h5 id="chase-block">Block<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#chase-block" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>

If you succeed, you move one <a href="#define-range">range category</a> away from the pursuer, and the pursuer must also roll <a href="#define-force">Force</a> [Driving] before resolving their own maneuver.

		<div id="define-chase-cut-off">
			<h5 id="chase-cut-off">Cut Off<a class="og-h-anchor" href="#chase-cut-off" title="Permalink" aria-hidden="true"></a></h5>
			<p>You try to find a shortcut and cut off the prey. This maneuver can only be done by the pursuer. Make an opposed <a href="#define-mobility">Mobility</a> [Driving] roll. If the range is <a href="#define-range">Long</a> or <a href="#define-range">Extreme</a>, you get a &minus;2 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a>. If you win the roll, the distance to the prey is immediately reduced to <a href="#define-range">Engaged</a>, and an immediate <a href="#define-close-combat">close combat</a>/<a href="#define-vehicle-combat">ramming attack</a> can be made as per above. If you lose or roll a tie, the distance is increased to <a href="#define-range">Extreme</a>. If the distance was already <a href="#define-range">Extreme</a>, the chase is over.</p>

			<p>What most people call magic is a catch-all term for forces at work behind the veil of the world, beyond what the common folk understand or dare perceive.</p>
			<p>Magic is a wild and unreliable force that can manifest itself in many ways. There are no schools of magic, instead knowledge is transferred from master to apprentice in a number of broad categories, called disciplines.</p>
			<p>There are seven disciplines in this SRD. Three of these are for druidic magic&mdash;<a href="#define-awareness">Awareness</a>, <a href="#define-healing-magic">Healing</a>, and <a href="#define-shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</a>&mdash;while four are for sorcery: <a href="#define-blood-magic">Blood Magic</a>, <a href="#define-death-magic">Death Magic</a>, <a href="#define-elementalism">Elementalism</a>, and <a href="#define-symbolism">Symbolism</a>. Every discipline is linked to a <a href="#define-specialty-tiered">tiered specialty</a>, that is a prerequisite to be able to cast <a href="#define-spell">spells</a> within each discipline.</p>

			<p>To learn a new discipline, or increase your rank in a discipline you already know, you should find a master with a higher rank than you in the magic <a href="#define-specialty">specialty</a> and who is ready to share their secrets with you. This can require both persuasion and substantial compensation. Without a teacher, the cost in <a href="#define-experience">XP</a> for increasing the rank in a magical specialty or learning a new one is tripled.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 30, Page 31</p>
			<p>Your attempts to use magic to impose your will on the world are called spells. A large number of spells are described later in this chapter.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Spell Ranks</dt>
				<dd>All spells in this chapter are rated in ranks ranging from 1 to 3. There can be spells of even higher rank. As a magic user, you can cast all spells that are at a rank equal to or lower than your rank in the related magical talent.</dd>
				<dt>Casting Times</dt>
				<dd>Casting a spell is generally a <a href="#define-action">slow action</a> in combat.</dd>
				<dt>Power Words</dt>
				<dd>Casting a power words spell is a <a href="#define-action">fast action</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Rituals</dt>
				<dd>Rituals can't be cast as an action in combat, as they require more time and preparation. A typical ritual takes a <a href="#define-time">shift</a> of time to perform. Rituals often have other prerequisites, such as ingredients that must be used to perform the ritual.</dd>
				<dt>Range</dt>
				<dd>Every spell has a range, which denotes the maximum distance at which it can be cast. The range Personal means the spell only affects yourself.</dd>
				<dt>Duration</dt>
				<dd>Every spell has a duration. Immediate means that the effect is instantaneous and does not last.</dd>
				<dt>Willpower Points (WP)</dt>
				<dd>Casting a spell requires a great deal of mental exertion and requires that you spend one or more Willpower Points (WP). You typically accumulate WP by <a href="#define-push">pushing dice rolls</a>, but some YZE games can introduce other ways to gain WP. The more WP you spend, the more powerful the effect of the spell is.</dd>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 30, Page 31</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Power Level</dt>
				<dd>The number of Willpower Points you spend when you cast a <a href="#define-spell">spell</a> is called its base power level. Dice rolls and other factors can further modify the power level. Casting a spell requires at least one Willpower Point. This applies even if it does not explicitly say so in the description of the spell.</dd>
				<dt>Rolling Dice</dt>
				<dd>Unlike <a href="#define-skill">skills</a>, you can never fail at casting a <a href="#define-spell">spell</a>. Instead, you roll a number of base dice (D6s) equal to the number of Willpower Points you spend. If you roll one or several successes (sixes), the spell is overcharged, and if you roll one or several <a href="#define-push">banes</a> (ones) you suffer some sort of <a href="#define-magic-mishap">magic mishap</a>. You cannot <a href="#define-push">push this roll</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Magic Mishap</dt>
				<dd>If you roll one or several <a href="#define-push">banes</a> when you cast a <a href="#define-spell">spell</a>, you have unleashed powerful forces but are unable to control them and you suffer a magic mishap. Roll D66 on the <a href="#define-magic-mishap">magic mishap table</a>.</dd>
				<dt>Safe Casting</dt>
				<dd>If you cast a <a href="#define-spell">spell</a> at a lower rank than your talent rank for the discipline, you may opt to roll one less die for every point of difference. This reduces the risk of a <a href="#define-magic-mishap">magic mishap</a>, but also makes the spell less likely to overcharge. If the result is zero dice or less, don't roll at all&mdash;the spell simply works as intended.</dd>
				<dt>Overcharging</dt>
				<dd>When you cast a <a href="#define-spell">spell</a>, every success you roll increases its power level by one. For example, if you spend 2 WP to cast a spell and roll two successes, its power level is increased to 4.</dd>
				<dt>Chance Casting</dt>
				<dd>If you really want to, you can cast a spell at one rank above the rank of your magical talent. However, this comes at a great risk, as you will automatically suffer a random <a href="#define-magic-mishap">magic mishap</a> in this case. You can never cast a spell that is two ranks or more above your talent rank.</dd>
				<dt>Grimoires</dt>
				<dd>You don't need your <a href="#define-spell">spells</a> written down to cast them, but it makes it easier to get it right. Grimoires are highly sought-after artifacts among sorcerers. If you cast a spell from a book or a scroll, its rank is considered one step lower than usual. In combat, you must spend a <a href="#define-action">fast action</a> readying your grimoire before you can cast the spell.</dd>
				<dt>NPCs &amp; Spellcasting</dt>
				<dd>NPCs don't have pools of Willpower Points. Instead, when an NPC casts a <a href="#define-spell">spell</a>, the GM may simply choose a base power level up to the caster's rank in the magic discipline used. Roll normally to determine any overcharging or <a href="#define-magic-mishap">magic mishap</a>.</dd>

			<p>Skilled sorcerers and druids can Bind spells to dead objects to create magical traps or powerful magical artifacts. You cast the spell like any other and choose how many Willpower Points to spend, but you must also spend extra WP to bind your spell to an object instead of unleashing its power immediately. Rituals cannot be Bound.</p>
			<p>Roll for any overcharge and mishap when the spell is Bound. The extra WP do affect this roll, but don't count toward the Power Level. If you spend one additional WP, the magic lingers for one day, or until the spell is triggered. If you spend two additional WP, the magic lingers forever, but dissipates when the spell is triggered. Spending five additional WP binds the spell to the object forever and it can be triggered once per day, at a cost in WP equal to the Power Level.</p>
			<p>You can bind the spell in whatever manner you wish. You decide how the spell is triggered. Common methods include a certain phrase being uttered or that the object is opened, broken or thrown to the ground. Once the spell is triggered, it has the same effect as if it had been cast normally.</p>

			<p>The main task of Death Magic is awakening the dead. In its simplest form, this ritual is used to reanimate one dead humanoid or animal, which will become a rank 1 undead.</p>
			<p>For each power level beyond the first, you can reanimate one more undead, or increase the rank of all undead raised by the spell by one. A ritual with power level 2 can raise two undead of rank 1, power level 3 can raise two undead of rank 2, and so on. A rank 1 undead has little to no mental capacity, but will obey simple commands and can use <a href="#define-weapon">weapons</a> and simple tools. The undead has the same <a href="#define-attribute">Strength</a> it did in life, <a href="#define-attribute">Agility</a> is decreased by one (no lower than 1), and it has no <a href="#define-attribute">Wits or Empathy</a>. <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> based on <a href="#define-attribute">Strength and Agility</a> are retained.</p>
			<p>A rank 2 undead can be enhanced in one of the following ways:</p>
			<ul class="og-list-diamond">
				<li><strong>Stronger:</strong> The <a href="#define-attribute">Strength</a> score increases by 1. This effect can be chosen several times for undead of higher ranks.</li>
				<li><strong>Smarter:</strong> The undead regains some of its lost mental capacity, in the form of both <a href="#define-attribute">Wits and Empathy</a> and <a href="#define-skill">skills</a> associated with these <a href="#define-attribute">attributes</a>. All the scores are lowered by one (no lower than 1). The undead can answer questions about its life both before and after death, but it often has an unclear sense of time and can be very forgetful. It obeys its maker and can perform slightly more advanced tasks.</li>
				<li><strong>Durable:</strong> The duration of the spell is doubled. This effect can be chosen several times for undead of higher levels.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A rank 3 undead gets two of the effects above. A rank 4 undead gets three effects, a rank 5 gets four effects, and so on.</p>

			<p class="og-ref">Page 39</p>
			<p>The discipline of Symbolism uses runes, esoteric signs and symbols that reflect the underlying patterns of the world. It takes advantage of the forces unleashed by a broad spectrum of laws that are stretched, broken or twisted by the influence of these symbols. The signs of Symbolism can be carved, drawn, or simply formed in the air by the hands of a sorcerer. In any case, the sorcerer needs at least one free hand. Draw or Carve: Symbolism requires no ingredients apart from the symbols themselves. If they are carved or drawn in any way, the power level is increased by one. Drawing a symbol takes a few minutes and cannot be done in the heat of battle. Carving a symbol into stone takes one <a href="#define-time">shift</a> or more. The Sorcerer decides when the symbol is activated. Even a drawn or carved symbol only works once.</p>

			<p>This powerful ritual tears a hole in the veil between worlds and opens a path between them. This is a very risky undertaking, since you run the risk of running into all sorts of demons and other malevolent creatures on the other side&mdash;perhaps you can use them for your own purposes, but it is just as likely they will attempt to use you for their own. Or perhaps devour you. The spell <a href="#define-bind-demon">Bind Demon</a> is very useful here. The details are up to the GM.

	<p>To regulate journeys, a travel map is used. A travel map is typically divided into hexagons, which are used to measure distances and govern <a href="#define-move">movement</a>. One hexagon is 10 kilometers across. Some YZE games use travel maps with square grids instead of hexagons.</p>

A few typical terrain types are summarized in the <a href="#define-terrain-examples">terrain examples</a> table, but you may want to invent others specific to your game setting. The terrain types affect travel speed as well as the difficulty of driving, foraging, and hunting.</dd>
		<dt>Roads</dt>
		<dd>Several major roads are marked on the travel map. Traveling along a major road is generally faster&mdash;but you also increase the risk of encounters. Only main roads count as roads for game purposes, even if the countryside is crisscrossed with tracks or even small dirt roads.</dd>
		<dt>Rivers</dt>
		<dd>Rivers are also not a type of terrain in themselves, but can be used for traveling. Fords and bridges can be used to pass over a river. If there are none, you need a raft or boat to cross a river, or you must swim across it.</dd>
		<dt>Speed</dt>
		<dd>Listed speeds are for off-road driving. For marching and on-road driving, the speed factor is always &times;1. Traveling at the listed speed on a lake/river requires a boat or amphibious <a href="#define-vehicle">vehicle</a>.</dd>

			<p>All characters in a modern setting are assumed to be able to drive any civilian <a href="#define-vehicle">vehicle</a> under normal circumstances. The <a href="#define-vehicle-list">vehicle list</a> indicates maximum travel speeds, in 10-kilometer hexes per <a href="#define-time">shift</a>. Two separate rates are given, one for traveling off-road and one for traveling on-road. If the listed speed for off-road travel is a dash (&mdash;) the vehicle cannot be driven off-road at all.</p>
			<p>Normally, you will choose on-road or off-road driving for a full shift, but the GM can allow splitting a shift in half, at their discretion.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Encounters</dt>
				<dd>As for marching, short breaks are included in the travel speeds for <a href="#define-vehicle">vehicles</a>, but if you stop for more than a few minutes, you will not be able to travel the entire distance. The GM has the final word on how many hexes of movement you lose when stopping for an encounter.</dd>
				<dt>Terrain</dt>
				<dd>When driving off-road, difficult <a href="#define-terrain">terrain</a> can reduce your speed. A terrain speed factor of &times;Â½ in a hex means that you need to spend two hexes of movement to drive into it, a speed factor of &times;1/3 means you need to spend three hexes of movement, <em>etc.</em> You will sometimes need to accumulate movement over multiple <a href="#define-time">shifts</a> to move into a hex. When driving on-road, the terrain has no effect.</dd>
				<dt>Driving at Night</dt>
				<dd>Driving off-road at night halves the effective travel speed, rounding fractions up.</dd>
				<dt>Mishaps</dt>
				<dd>At the start of each <a href="#define-time">shift</a> you drive, you must make a <a href="#define-skill-roll">skill roll</a> for driving, modified for <a href="#define-terrain">terrain</a> type. If you drive off-road into a new terrain type during a shift, you need to make an additional roll. In heavy rain, you get a &minus;2 <a href="#define-modifier">modifier</a>. If you fail, you suffer a mishap&mdash;make a roll on the <a href="#define-driving-mishaps">driving mishap table</a>. Typically, a mishap occurs about halfway into the movement of the shift&mdash;the GM decides the exact hex.</dd>
				<dt>Fuel</dt>
				<dd><a href="#define-vehicle">Vehicles</a> need fuel to operate. The <a href="#define-vehicle-list">lists</a> in <a href="#define-chapter-5">Chapter 5</a> indicate each vehicle's fuel capacity (in liters) and fuel consumption (in liters per hex driven). Off-road, the fuel consumption is doubled.</dd>
				<dt>Mounts</dt>
				<dd>During travel, you can only ride for two <a href="#define-time">shifts</a> per day. To ride for a third shift, you need to make a <a href="#define-mobility">Mobility</a> roll.

You don't need to have a lookout, but without one you have no chance of spotting threats before they are upon you. During journeys, the lookout makes a passive <a href="#define-observation">Observation</a> roll (cannot be <a href="#define-push">pushed</a>) when the GM indicates that the group is approaching an encounter. The distance between the lookout and the encounter depends on the <a href="#define-terrain">terrain</a> that you are traveling in. See the <a href="#define-terrain-examples">example terrain table</a>.</p>
			<p>If the roll is successful, your lookout spots the other group before you are spotted yourselves. You can then decide whether to show yourselves, back off, or set up an ambush. If your <a href="#define-observation">Observation</a> roll fails, the other group spots you first.</p>
			<dl>

			<p>If you are running out of provisions, you can spend a <a href="#define-time">shift</a> looking for edible plants or drinkable water in your current hex. To forage, first choose whether you are looking for food or water. Then make a <a href="#define-survival">Survival</a> roll, modified by the <a href="#define-terrain">terrain</a> type.</p>
			<p>When foraging for food, success means that you find a number of rations of raw food equal to the number of successes you rolled. You can eat raw plants, but you will then need to make a <a href="#define-disease">sickness</a> roll against virulence 3 (D) to resist food poisoning.</p>
			<p>Only one character can forage for food or water in the same hex during the same shift, but others can <a href="#define-help">help</a> the roll.

			<p>Another way to find food during a journey is to hunt in your current hex. First roll for <a href="#define-survival">Survival</a>, modified for the <a href="#define-terrain">terrain</a> type. Success means that you have tracked some kind of prey. Roll on a hunting table based on the game setting to see what type of animal it is. If you roll multiple successes, you manage to track several prey&mdash;roll once for each, and then choose which one to hunt.</p>
			<p>To kill a prey you have tracked, you must first make an <a href="#define-observation">Observation</a> roll to move into position without alerting the animal. Second, you must make a <a href="#define-ranged-combat">ranged</a> attack against the animal. If your attack inflicts <a href="#define-damage">damage</a> equal to or in excess of the <a href="#define-health-resolve">Health</a> rating of the animal, or if you score a critical hit, the animal is killed. If not, it's only wounded and escapes. You usually only get one shot.</p>
			<p>The hunting table indicates how many rations of (domestic) food that your prey yields, once the meat has been cut and <a href="#define-cook">cooked</a>. You can eat raw meat, but you will then need to make a <a href="#define-disease">sickness</a> roll against virulence 6 (C) to resist food poisoning.</p>
